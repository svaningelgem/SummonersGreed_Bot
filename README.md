Bot for the game Summoner's Greed.


**Needs BlueStacks** (I'm using 5.2.50.1002 N32)

It will "click" on the right buttons. Even when the window is in the background (but not when it's minimized!).

Map: ***The Joint Revenge***, Mode: ***Normal***

*Warning*: see that your monster setup is correctly done. I'm just clicking buttons!

So these actions are interfaced:
- Getting gems from achievements
- Denying the monitor (too difficult to interface ads)
- Accepting whatever the seller is selling
- Clicking on the "game won" button
- Selecting JR again
- Accepting the already placed monsters for a new game
